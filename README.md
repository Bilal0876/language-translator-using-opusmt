# Language Translator (OPUS-MT)

A multilingual language translation project built using Helsinki-NLP OPUS-MT models,
Naive Bayes language detection, and a Flask-based web interface. 
This project demonstrates language detection, translation between multiple languages, 
and a simple web frontend for testing translations.
